## Developing tools for next generation landscape genomics
The field of landscape genomics aims to understand patterns of local adaptation and connectivity by integrating genomic and environmental data. I am working on developing tools that leverage big genomic and spatial data to understand processes of evolution in natural systems. As part of this work I have developed a novel method for creating continuous maps of genomic diversity using moving windows available as the R package [wingen](https://github.com/AnushaPB/wingen).

## California Conservation Genomics Project
I am working to develop landscape genomic analysis pipelines for whole-genome data with [Anne Chambers](https://eannechambers.wordpress.com/about/) as part of the Landscape Genomics Team for the California Conservation Genomics Project. These pipelines will process genomic data from hundreds of California species and the results will be used to inform conservation efforts across the state. We have published one such pipeline in the form of the R package [algatr](https://github.com/TheWangLab/algatr), which provides start-to-finish guidance for many common landscape genomic analyses.

## Diversity in western fence lizards

Western fence lizards (*Sceloporus occidentalis*) inhabit a wide range of habitats and exhibit remarkable phenotypic diversity across their range; this makes them a great system for studying the interplay of environmental, genetic, and phenotypic diversity. I am applying novel landscape genomics methods to study ecological and evolutionary dynamics in western fence lizards across California.
