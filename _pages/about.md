I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley conducting research on how evolution plays out across landscapes with the goal of understanding species vulnerability to environmental change. My work involves building and applying tools for studying genomic variation, connectivity, and adaptation. 

I am part of the [Wang Lab](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/wang-lab) in the [Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/) and an affiliate of the [Museum of Vertebrate Zoology](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/). I am on the Landscape Genomics Team for the [California Conservation Genomics Project](https://www.ccgproject.org/) and I work as a Senior Consulting Fellow for the [Berkeley D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/consulting/consultants/anusha-bishop).
